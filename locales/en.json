    "text": "Over 10 years in mobile gamedev. I do 2D and 3D animation, prototype gameplay, model low-poly assets, and help bring ideas to life fast. I work closely with devs, artists, and game designers for a smooth and creative process. Currently based in Argentina. In my free time, I love 3D printing custom miniatures for D&D, experimenting with new tools (recently C# and a bit of Spanish!), and integrating AI into my workflows.",
