    "title": "About Me",
    "text": "I've been creating mobile games for over 10 years — doing 2D/3D animation, gameplay prototypes, and low-poly models. I like experimenting with different tools like Blender, Photoshop, Unity, and Godot to find the best way to bring ideas to life. I work closely with developers, artists, and designers to keep projects creative and efficient. Now based in Argentina, I mix gamedev with 3D printing, coding, and web design as a hobby. I also play games, learn Spanish, and explore how AI can boost creativity and simplify workflows.",
