  "title": "About Me",
  "text": "For over 10 years, I’ve been working in mobile game production as a versatile specialist — from 2D/3D character animation, environment and UI, to creating visual effects, modeling, and texturing. My experience with Blender, Photoshop, Unity, Godot, and other tools allows me to quickly find efficient solutions for any task. I collaborate closely with programmers, artists, and game designers, keeping the process both productive and creative. I’ve also held a lead position — sharing my artistic experience effectively and helping teammates grow through feedback and guidance. I currently live in Argentina. In my free time, I enjoy 3D printing, coding, making websites as a hobby, playing games, learning Spanish, and integrating AI tools to streamline workflows.",
